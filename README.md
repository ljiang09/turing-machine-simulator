FOCS 2024 final project: turing machine visual simulator


## How to run locally

`npm install` when you first downlaod this repo, to get all required dependencies

`npm start` to run the front-end app locally in the browser

In a separate terminal, run `npm run start-api` to start the back-end (so the API calls work)
